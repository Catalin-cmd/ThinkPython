Question 24
Question:

    Python has many built-in functions, and if you do not know how to use it, you can read document online or find some books. 
    But Python has a built-in document function for every built-in functions.

    Please write a program to print some Python built-in functions documents, such as abs(), int(), raw_input()

    And add document for your own function

Hints:'''

class Documennt:
    '''You can see what is here with __doc__ function'''
    
print((Documennt().__doc__))
print(str.__doc__)
